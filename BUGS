bash fails to expand variable after `function' keyword, so no:

function $var {
}

is allowed because bash takes `$var' as a string literal.
So, script_name.bash in prfoile directory cannot be defined beforhand as
functions. This is where the:

function ata {
	source "$ata_bash"
}

comes from. Sorry for that, but extra scripts should taken care of in particular
sub-profile files, either by defining a function (more effecient and is worth the
definition) by a call like `${bash:-bash} -c "$script_name_bash"' (sub-shell and
cal by value... far from being optimal solution.)
